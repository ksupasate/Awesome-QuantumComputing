# Awesome Quantum Computing

A curated learning path for quantum computing practitioners, reorganized into modular documentation sourced from `claude.md`. Each section covers a different stage of the journey—from conceptual fundamentals through advanced research frontiers—with linked references for deeper study.

## Repository layout

- `docs/index.md` – landing page with navigation and context on how to use the guide.
- `docs/0*-*.md` – individual chapters for each major topic (introduction, mathematics, tooling, algorithms, research, etc.).
- `docs/11-works-cited.md` – consolidated bibliography matching the numbered citations in every chapter.
- `claude.md` – original planning document that the project content was derived from.

## Using the guide

Browse the Markdown files directly in your editor or render them with your favorite static-site tooling (e.g., MkDocs, Docusaurus). The chapter files are ordered numerically to mirror a recommended learning progression. Citation numbers in the prose map back to `docs/11-works-cited.md` for full source details.

## Next steps

- Convert the `docs/` directory into a published site (Material for MkDocs works well with multi-page guides).
- Keep the bibliography current by appending new references to `docs/11-works-cited.md` and reusing the numbering scheme within the chapters.
